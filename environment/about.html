                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>The Environment Department is involved in constructing and utilizing transportation structures, mapping and presenting our island geographies, climate information and forecasting weather, and general information about the islands.
                </p>
                <h3>Clarence Maps</h3>
                <p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In the wake of the booming new populations after the war, the beginnings of the Environment Department were being formed. People and land needed to be organized to prevent overcrowding, and an agency needed to be formed to organize those decisions being made. In the year xxx, Clarence the (?) officially established us as the ___ Department.
                <br>
                As the populations grew and transit needs increased, we were further tasked with organizing transportation within and between islands. We transformed simple dirt paths into extensive roads, highways, flight paths, water ways, and more. And alongside these physical structures, we developed the state of the art, and first of its kind map and navigation software to allow Clarence citizens to meet their travel needs.
