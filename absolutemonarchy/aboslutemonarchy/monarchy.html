            We have a purpose, to spread our seed to every corner of the world. Long ago 
            in the barren wasteland that was the world the first Clarence, Clarence the Uniter, 
            appeared and with them our seed came. The seed made what we know now, mushroom filled 
            valleys and mountains, the start of a new civilization named Clarence, in his honor. 
            Through our mushroom filled existence we bring a great life for our people, we know 
            what is best for our people. No one can stop the force that is Clarence and those we 
            oppose will perish. We are a civilization of dreams and potential and we will direct 
            the world into our vision that is greatness. Everybody will follow us and we’ll make 
            sure of it because we know what is the correct path towards the perfect future.

            Mushrooms are a way of life. We live, we breathe and we consume mushrooms. They are 
            everything to us and they should be everything to the rest of the world and believe 
            firmly in that. We will stop at nothing to ensure everybody experiences life under our 
            rule. Mushrooms are the elixir of life, the good to the bad, we as a community need to 
            work together to keep it that way. Our life is devoted to its survival and yours 
            should be too.

            As a people devoted we have to be devoted to our survival, to our expansion, to the 
            spreading of our seed. Follow our rules and you’ll have a great life in Clarence. The 
            monarchy knows the best for you, do no doubt it and definitely do not antagonize us. We 
            are everything and we can help you be everything.

                No one will ever forget The Uniter as they are the reason we are here.

                Long ago, during the reign of The Gray, our community lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the angry mushrooms attacked. Only Clarence, master of all mushrooms, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Clarence. And although his skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Clarence can save the world
